<!--
DOM is a 2 way API
    API: a function/ method where you know what it does

    that means you know the input and the output of the function
    but you don't know how the function was created

    console.log(add(3,4));  input----two numbers
                            output----sum

    payment apis-----
    
    inner.html is a DOM function that you can use to add js content to an HTML page

    but you don't know how inner.html was created and you don't need to
    
    DOM is an API that offers some methods/ properties that you can use 
    to add dynamic content to your static html page
    DOM is a host object---it has certain properties/ methods you can use

    Steps for adding dynamic content to HTML page

    1. Add a container in HTML page where you want to put your js content
    2. write your js code
    3. create a reference for your container
    4. use window.onload to add the content in the container using inner.html
5. YOU MUST MUST MUST PUT THE INNERHTML CODE AND CONTAINER REFERENCE INSIDE 
WINDOW.ONLOAD!!!!!!!!!!!

when the browser renders your html code to show in your browser window as content
it generates a tree called the DOM tree

-->

<script>
// add your js content here

var fruits = ["apples","bananas","oranges","mangoes","Strawberry"];
var age = 18;

var student = {
    name:"Sharmin",
    id: 123456,
    program:"CSD",
    print:function(){
        return this.name+" "+this.id+" "+this.program;
    }
}

window.onload=function(){
// the js code execution here needs to wait until the browser has finished loading
// the page. This is achieved by using the event window.onload


    // creates reference of container with id "a" in variable container
   /// the following codes MUST BE INSIDE window.onload
    var container = document.getElementById("a");
    var container1 = document.getElementById("b");
    var student_info = document.getElementById("c");
    var img = document.getElementById("fig");

    var imagename = "logo.png";


    container1.innerHTML="<p>The age when you start college is "+age+"</p>";

    student_info.innerHTML = "<h1>"+student.print()+"</h1>";

    img.innerHTML = "<img src='"+imagename+"'/>";
    
    var str = "<ol>";
        for(var i=0;i<fruits.length;i++){
            str+="<li>"+fruits[i]+"</li>";
        }
        str+="</ol>";
        container.innerHTML=str;
};

</script>
           <!--
        this div is the container where you will place your js content
        ----->
    <div id="a"></div>
     <div id = "b"></div>
     <div id = "c"></div>
     <figure id="fig"> </figure>
